Hello — my name is Hamida Sajjad, and this video demonstrates my PDE4431 Coursework 2 manipulator simulation.

📁 Project Overview

This project simulates a 4-DoF articulated manipulator using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
The robot configuration follows the joint order:

Revolute

Revolute

Revolute

Prismatic

This is sometimes called an RRRP manipulator.
It provides horizontal reach through the revolute joints and vertical motion through the prismatic axis, allowing the arm to pick objects from the floor and place them onto multi-level shelves.

🦾 Robot Model & Kinematics

The robot class (ArticulatedRRRP) implements:

Forward Kinematics (FK):
Used to compute and visualize all joint positions.

Inverse Kinematics (IK):
The IK solves the 2-link planar geometry for x-y positioning,
and sets the prismatic joint extension to reach the required z-level.

The IK also includes reach clamping — whenever a target is outside the workspace, the solver automatically adjusts the position so the manipulator moves as close as physically possible.

📂 Code & Structure

The simulation consists of:

A robot model file containing FK and IK

A simulation file containing UI buttons, object logic, and animated motion

A full 3D environment with a floor, objects, shelves, and a home position

Smooth interpolation between poses for realistic motion

▶️ Live Demonstration

I will now run the simulation.

On the left side of the window, there are interactive control buttons:

Floor 1

Floor 2

Floor 3

Reset

Each floor button triggers a full pick-and-place sequence:

The robot moves above the object,

Lowers to pick it,

Lifts up to a safe height,

Moves toward the shelf,

Lowers again,

Releases the object,

And returns upward.

The vertical positioning comes from the prismatic joint, which adjusts to match each shelf’s height.

My shelves in this simulation are placed at three levels, and each object is placed on its correct corresponding shelf.

The entire animation uses smooth trajectory interpolation between IK solutions.

📌 Results

All three objects are picked correctly from the floor.

Each object is placed on its designated shelf without teleporting or errors.

The inverse kinematics correctly handles reachable and near-boundary targets.

The simulation demonstrates stable RRRP kinematic behavior.
